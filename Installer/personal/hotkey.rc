;--> These were setup to mimic the hotkeys available in the explorer shell
;    Please note that the hotkeys are defined based on those in XP

*Hotkey WIN         R       !Run
*Hotkey WIN         E       "$FileManager$"
*Hotkey WIN         PAUSE   control.exe sysdm.cpl
*Hotkey WIN         M       !MinimizeWindows

jKeyLWinKey                 !Popup
jKeyLWinKeyTimeout          750                 ;you can play around with this

*Hotkey CTRL+SHIFT  F1      "http://lsdocs.shellfront.org/"


;--> Some more useful LiteStep-specific hotkeys, related to the VWM. They're
;    disabled since the first two might be used by gamers, and the second two
;    by IE/Mozilla users.

;    You should uncomment them and try them out some time. :P
