Welcome to ALI - Another LiteStep Installer.


ALI requires Windows Vista and higher.


ALI is a new LiteStep installer that uses current Alpha builds of LiteStep and the latest xPaintClass.
While ALI does currently use files from LOSI, I'm working to make ALI a completely new installer.

TODO:


Write a new application for setting up evars that is run after install and can be used at anytime for easy evar setup.

Add check in installer for evars setup application.

Write a new shell switcher.  DONE.


Possible in the future:


Write a new module manager.

Write a new theme manager.
